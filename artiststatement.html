  <li>From my perspectives, art is a way of communication. During the process of making art works, people can convey their own feelings to public, and the others can try to understand them by interpreting artworks. Sometimes art can be educational, encouraging audiences to better understand the beautiful side of the world. I like art because its versatility. Art can be everything, include films, music, pictures, human bodies, novels, sculptures, games, and architecture. Art is magical and mysterious.

  <li>I have wanted to become a storyteller since my young age. At first, I wrote magical stories because I was inspired by the Harry Potter series. I was fascinated by the world Rolling created in her books. I was moved by the beautiful spirits that Harry and his friends showed. And I bet most of my peers were influenced by these books. That is the power of art. Time passed, I decided to draw the characters I created, designing stories for them. At that time, I graduated from my junior high school and had to move to another district. But I really missed my old house. It stands for my childhood and many ordinary but friendly neighbors. Therefore, I also recorded past life in my stories. Art can help me recall the past and lovely people around me.
</li>
<br>
<li>
  As I grow up, I began to know more and more extinguished animators, filmmakers and writers. I really like the way they tell stories and convey emotions. I even cry for some movies, for the frames, color tones, stories, and characters.
</li>
<br>
<li>
  In a word, I want to convey my ideas and feelings through stories, finding audiences who have the same thoughts with me. Art is also a way of making friends for me.
